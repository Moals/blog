     If we were receiving data from a form, for example in a search box, we would use GET.

      You should use it for all your Django forms -->

  Then to output our form data we use {{ form.as_p }} which renders the specified fields within paragraph <p> tags.
  Finally, specify an input type of submit and assign it the value “Save”
